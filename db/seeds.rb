# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
User.create!({ email: "admin@example.org", password: "password", password_confirmation: "password" })
